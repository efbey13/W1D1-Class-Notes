# Pieces of infrmation we will be using

# Numbers- Integers or Decimal Numbers
# Strings- Words, any amount of characters, always surrounded by quotes
# Booleans- Either true or false, never both at the same time

# remainder will never be greater than the number on the right side of modulo operator
# it will keep cycling from 0 up to but not including the number
# ruby operators has its own order of operations
# Negative indexing
# neagative indexing starts at -1, it always gets the last character in the string no matter what
